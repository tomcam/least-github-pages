# Privacy warning: GitHub Pages sites are public even if your repo is private

GitHub allows you to create private repos. All GitHub Pages sites are generated from GitHub repos. However, GitHub Pages allows
you to create a publication from a private repo. Currently there's no way to turn off this feature, so don't use a GitHub Pages
link unless you want your private repo to be visible to the entire Internet.
