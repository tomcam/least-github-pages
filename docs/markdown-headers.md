## Headers in Markdown

Lines starting with `#` get converted to HTML H1 headers, lines starting with `##` become H2 headers, and so on.
Organize your site carefully using headers because levels H1-H3 are indexed automatically by search engines.
Putting words most relevant to your audience into headers also helps in search engine results.

```markdown
# Top level header, aka H1

H1 is the most important header.

## Second level header

This gets converted to an H2

### Third-level header

Most search engines index only up to H3 for searches

#### Level 4 header, aka H4

People remember only about 3 levels of a hierarchy

##### H5

Who goes this low? and why?

###### H6

A level 6 header is used only by spelunkers.

```

And the result is pretty much what you'd expect:

# Top level header, aka H1

H1 is the most important header.

## Second level header

This gets converted to an H2

### Third-level header

Most search engines index only up to H3 for searches

#### Level 4 header, aka H4

People remember only about 3 levels of a hierarchy

##### H5

Who goes this low? and why?

###### H6

A level 6 header is used only by spelunkers.
